I will soon be uploading the full performance from which this clip was taken, so watch this here space. A small few people have tried to bribe me to do so, by offering donations via PayPal. I accepted them, and wish I had thought of it sooner:

https://www.paypal.com/donate/?token=j4KjWvy2fn4rAyWQG03cMjmgah6oQuLjDRNkzyWjekA0oQ-dFk77Rd5CzkI2nFIA8hfhWm&country.x=GB&locale.x=GB

 - a small donation from occasional viewers could've paid my medical bills in recent years. Who was I to expect such viewing figures back when I uploaded this amazing clip?

Its never too late though, am I right?
