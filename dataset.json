It is based on the Prelude in A major, Op. 28, No. 7, by Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Chopin. It started out as a piece for cello and piano, written in collaboration between Mompou and the cellist Gaspar Cassad\u00f3. Work on this version of the piece started in 1938, but was abandoned. Mompou then published four variations for solo piano, but with the incongruous title Three Variations.[1] Kenneth MacMillan's ballet La Casa de los P\u00e1jaros (The House of Birds), set to orchestrations by John Lanchbery of various piano pieces by Mompou, had been premiered at Sadler's Wells in London in 1955, and was also staged at the 4th Festival de M\u00fasica y Danza at Granada. Mompou was then asked by The Royal Ballet, London[2] to write another ballet in the hope of emulating the success of La Casa de los P\u00e1jaros. For this, Mompou completed the full set of 12 variations in 1957. The latter ballet was never produced, and the music was published as Variations on a Theme of Chopin, without any reference to any balletic connections.[3]The work was dedicated to Mompou's friend Pedro Masaveu, a banker who had made available to Mompou his house in which to compose.[3]\n\nThis video is for educational purposes only.\nFair Use Act Disclaimer\n\u00a9 COPYRIGHT Disclaimer, Under Section 107 of the Copyright Act 1976.

Duett\nOhne Verschulden Knechtschaft dulden, harte Noth! \nAlle Tage neue Plage um das bischen liebe Brot! \nVon den Zweigen winkt der Feigen s\u00fcsse Frucht, \nNicht dem Knechte der sie pflegte, \nNur dem Herren, dem er flucht! \nHingegeben wilden Horden, \nTiefgebeugt in ihre Hand, \nach! ach! ach! ach! \nWas ist aus dir geworden, \nArmes, armes Vaterland! \n\n4.

What ever you are fighting about, both versions were WONDERFUL in their own rights. And yes, they went to court, Lord Invader won.\n\nUpdate (3/11/11): I want to thank all you Mafia and Fallout gamers for watching this video OVER AND OVER AGAIN! I also want to thank the fans of the Andrews Sisters' and many other people who have watched this, making this become MY most watched video! ALL OF YOU ROCK! THANK YOU AGAIN!\n\nUpdate: If you really like this song by the Andrews Sisters, you've got to hear the remix of this: (uploaded by trekdropsec):\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fD7gp7aqWdo\n\nI personally love this song, and really influences me to drink rum and coke... but I hate alcohol, LOL, so you won't be seeing me drinking! I was so shocked to find out that the first Rum and Coca Cola video was deleted. I made this one around 4 to7 days ago... hope you enjoy! Drink rum and coca cola all day... everyday (Just kidding)!

F\u00e9tis named Amsterdam as his place of birth. He was married in Jungbunzlau, Bohemia (now Mlad\u00e1, Czech Republic) in the late 1750s; a daughter, Anna Christina (later a singer in Cologne and the mother of Bernhard Klein), was born in 1759. During the 1760s Schwindl held at least two posts, first as Konzertmeister to the Margrave of Wied-Runkel, and then as virtuoso di camera to the Count of Colloredo (later Colloredo-Mansfield). He may have accepted the latter position as early as 1763, as both he and Colloredo are listed in Leopold Mozart\u2019s travel notes of October 1763 (Brussels); a set of symphonies (op.3, 1765) carries the same title. In 1770, shortly before or after becoming a resident of The Hague, Schwindl travelled to Switzerland for a three-month engagement as violinist with the Z\u00fcrich Musiksaalgesellschaft. During his stay in The Hague he composed, taught (one of his pupils was the composer and harpsichordist J.A. Just), and also served as first violinist to Prince William V of Orange. Apparently still in the latter\u2019s employ in 1772, Schwindl travelled to Trier to appear in a concert of his music given on 22 July. Towards the mid-1770s Switzerland became the centre of his interests: besides giving concerts in Z\u00fcrich, between 1774 and 1780 he organized and performed in a number of concerts in Geneva; and in the late 1770s he directed a Liebhaberkonzert in Mulhouse. On 21 September 1780 Schwindl became Konzertmeister to the Margrave of Bad Durlach (Karlsruhe), an appointment he held until his death. Further travels took place in 1783 and again in 1786 (Lausanne).",

        "description": "Max Bruch (6 January 1838 \u2013 2 October 1920) was a German Romantic composer, teacher, and conductor who wrote over 200 works, including three violin concertos, the first of which has become a staple of the violin repertoire.\n\nPlease support my channel:\nhttps://ko-fi.com/bartjebartmans\n\nScottish Fantasy, Op. 46 (1880)\nDedication: Pablo de Sarasate (1844-1908)\n\nIntroduction: Grave (0:00)\nI. Adagio cantabile (3:51)\nII. Scherzo: Allegro (8:29)\nIII. Andante sostenuto (14:48)\nIV. Finale: Allegro guerriero (21:46)\n\nNicola Benedetti, violin and the BBC Scottish Symphony Orchestra conducted by Rory Macdonald\n\nDescription by Roger Dettmer  [-]\nBruch composed this work in 1880 for violinist Pablo de Sarasate, who played the first performance at Hamburg in September of that year. The orchestra includes two each of winds, trumpets and percussion, four horns, three trombones, and timpani. The Nazis lumped Bruch among a host of \"racially impure\" composers (including Mendelssohn and Mahler) whose music they banned. Yet this son of a noted soprano and a civil servant was descended from German-Protestant stock. Although his canon included two string quartets and nearly 50 works for chorus and orchestra, he is chiefly remembered today for the first violin concerto, the Scottish Fantasy, and a variation setting for cello and orchestra of the Yom Kippur chant Kol Nidrei -- most likely the reason for his blacklisting by the \"Thousand-Year Reich.\"\n\nFollowing Paganini's meteoric career after he left Italy, the most famous nineteenth century violinists were German-schooled Joseph Joachim (who played the definitive version of Bruch's first concerto in 1868), and the virtuosic Spanish showman, Pablo de Sarasate. For the latter, Bruch composed not only his second concerto (in 1877) and Scottish Fantasy, but a failed third concerto and a serenade. Bruch wrote more for Sarasate than did any other composer, and while Bruch was fonder of his Second Concerto, the Fantasia Freely Using Scottish Folk Melodies (the present work's formal title) proved to be far more popular.\n\nBruch freely admitted the influence exerted upon the work by Walter Scott, whose writings had ensnared Bruch's attention during a conducting stint in England in 1880; Scott's Lady of the Lake inspired a subsequent cantata, Das Feuerkreuz. The Fantasia opens with a slow, solemnly bardic introduction for brass and harp, and then a recitative for the soloist on a soft cushion of strings. This leads directly to an Adagio cantabile in E flat major, based on the song \"Auld Robin Morris,\" with the harp nearly as prominent as the violin's decorations.\n\nThe G major second movement has various titles -- \"Scherzo: Allegro\" and \"Dance\" -- and is based on \"Hey, the Dusty Miller.\" Drone basses imitate the sound of bagpipes, while the violin adds all manner of pyrotechnics after it introduces the tune on double-stopped strings (two strings played with one stroke of the bow). The merriment ends with a bridge passage recalling \"Auld Robin Morris.\" This leads without pause to the third movement, a set of plushly sonorous variations in slower time, Andante sostenuto, on the song \"I'm Down for Lack o' Johnnie.\" The violin rhapsodizes eloquently throughout, and concludes with a memorable sigh.\n\nBruch gave his finale the same warlike marking, Allegro guerriero, that Mendelssohn used in the last movement of his Scottish Symphony. \"Scots wha hae\" is the dominant folk melody, legendarily sung by Robert the Bruce at the Battle of Bannockburn. The violin adds excitement by playing on two, three, even four strings simultaneously until a tender reprise of the first movement. \"Scots wha hae\" returns, however, to conclude the four-movement work rousingly.",
